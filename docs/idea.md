# Project Idea

## Overview
A simple home automation system on the Arduino platform that responds to certain real world events.

## Goals
- Add a light control system that dims the lights when it is dark and turns them on when it is light.
- Control the lights based on the time of day.
- Turn on the lights when motion is detected.
- Trigger an alarm when smoke is detected.
- Control the lights when smoke is detected.
- Add more features as needed.

## Features
- **Light Control**: Turn on/off lights based on motion detection.
- **Light Dimmer**: Adjust light brightness based on ambient light.
- **Light Controller**: Control lights based on time of day.
- **Fire Alarm**: Trigger an alarm when smoke is detected.
- **Fire Alarm**: Control lights when smoke is detected.

## Technologies
- **Arduino**: The main microcontroller platform.
- **LED**: For visual feedback.
- **Buzzer**: For audio feedback.
- **Fire Sensor**: To detect smoke or fire.
- **RTC**: To keep track of time.?
- **PIR**: To detect motion.
- Other sensors as needed.
